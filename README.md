## Work Overview
Documenting my Data Analysis journey with the Incubator Hub. It's been two months of learning new Tech skills, thanks to the innovators  of this program for giving many people around the world, the opportunity to stand tall in IT industry, Also to the amazing instructors who walked us through the steps, and made learning stages understandable even to all categories of people.
Learning basic Fundamentals of some tools in data analysis has been a challenge for me until I was opportune to learn them with Incubator Hub. Three major data analysis tools learned are:
1. Microsoft Excel 
2. Structured Query Language (SQL).
3. Power BI.
   
All of these tools  are unique in their way of treating and analyzing data. And possesses different ways of bringing meaningful inferences from figures. I will say Facts from figures.
