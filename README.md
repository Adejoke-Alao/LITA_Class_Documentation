## Work Overview
Documenting my Data Analysis journey with the Incubator Hub. It's been two months of learning new Tech skills, thanks to the innovators  of this program for giving many people around the world, the opportunity to stand tall in IT industry, Also to the amazing instructors who walked us through the steps, and made learning stages understandable even to all categories of people.
Learning basic Fundamentals of some tools in data analysis has been a challenge for me until I was opportune to learn them with Incubator Hub. Three major data analysis tools learned are:
1. Microsoft Excel 
2. Structured Query Language (SQL).
3. Power BI.
 
All of these tools  are unique in their way of treating and analyzing data. And possesses different ways of bringing meaningful inferences from figures. I will say Facts from figures.
In Excel class, we were taught the definition of Data as finding hidden patterns and unseen trends, discovering correlations & deriving valuable insights to make predictions in Business and other fields. Why Do We Need Data, How Data is Used, Different Types Of Data Analytics as:
a. Descriptive Analytics - insight into what has happened, answered the question " what has happened in past with the similar data".
b. Predictive Analytics - talks about forecasting what might happen in the future.
c. Prescriptive Analytics- Not only what will happen, when it will happen, why it will happen & further suggest decision options on how to take advantage of the future opportunity or mitigate a risk.

There are Data Analyst skills like Basic mathematical or statistical skills, ability to analyse models & interprete data, problem solving skills, method and logical approach, ability to plan, work & meet deadlines, accuracy and attention to details, interpersonal and teamwork skills, written and verbal communication skills.
